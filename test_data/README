CAFU_test_data contains five folders ("PE RNA-Seq", "SE RNA-Seq", "genomes", "SAT", "others")

* PE RNA-Seq
This dataset is provided for module i) unmapped read extraction and ii) de novo transcript assembly of unmapped reads.

* SE RNA-Seq
This dataset is provided for function "Analyze Differential expression" of module vi) expression profiles of assembled transcripts.

* genomes
This dataset is provided for two functions, one is "Extract Unmapped Reads", the other is "Genome-level Evidence" or "Transcripts-level Evidence".

Of this, "maize.fa" and "maize.gff3" are also used for function "Extract Sequences".

* SAT
This dataset is provided for function "SAT".

* others
This folder includes four files. 

"assembled_transcript.fasta" is used for module iii) Evidence support of assembled transcripts.

"assembled_transcript_expression" and "RNA-Seq_sample_information" are used for function "Analyze Condition Specificity".

"assembled_transcript_expression" can also be used for function "Analysis Heterogeneous".

"differentially_expressed_transcript_expression" is used for vii) function annotation of assembled transcripts.
