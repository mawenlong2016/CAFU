### Brief introduction
- CAFU is a Galaxy-based bioinformatics framework for comprehensive assembly and functional annotation of unmapped RNA-seq data from single- and mixed-species samples which integrates plenty of existing NGS analytical tools and our developed programs, and features an easy-to-use interface to manage, manipulate and most importantly, explore large-scale unmapped reads. Besides the common process of reads cleansing, reads mapping, unmapped reads generation and novel transcription assembly, CAFU optionally offers the multiple-level evidence analysis of assembled transcripts, the sequence and expression characteristics of assembled transcripts, and the functional exploration of assembled transcripts through gene co-expression analysis and genome-wide association analysis. Taking the advantages of machine learning (ML) technologies, CAFU also effectively addresses the challenge of classifying species-specific transcript assembled using unmapped reads from mixed-species samples. The CAFU project is hosted on GitHub(https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU) and can be accessed from http://bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn:4001. In addition, in order to enable large-scale analysis, we also provided a standardized Docker image: [CAFU Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/cafu/).


### CAFU Docker image installation
- Step 1: [Docker installation](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/tutorial/Docker_installation.md)
- Step 2: CAFU installation from Docker Hub

### UNMAPPED READ EXTRACTION
In this section, we provide an example to show how to use CAFU modules to perform unmapped reads extraction.
- **Quality control**

  In this module, we implemented FastQC (Andrews *et al*., 2010) to enable users to perform quality control. In this tutorial, we use a list of single-end RNA-Seq collection file (located in the folder ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/```) to perform quality controlï¼ˆsee section **Upload collection file** to see how to upload collection).


  ![Quality control](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/9.png)


  This toolkit produces a basic text and a HTML output file that containing:

  - Basic Statistics
  - Per base sequence quality
  - Per sequence quality scores
  - Per base sequence content
  - Per base GC content
  - Per sequence GC content
  - Per base N content
  - Sequence Length Distribution
  - Sequence Duplication Levels
  - Overrepresented sequences
  - Kmer Content

  You can access the output by click results in the right history bar.


  ![Quality control](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/10.png)


- **Trim raw reads**

  In this function, poly-A/T is firstly trimmmed using fqtrim (Pertea, 2015), and then high-quality reads (score > 20) are retained by Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). The reads less than 20bp (in default) are discarded. Here, we used the same collection with last step (single-end RNA-Seq experiments) to trim raw reads.


  ![Quality control](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/11.png)


  For each FASTQ format files, CAFU returns two files including:

  - ```fqtrim_DATA_ID.fastq```: poly-A/T trimmed RNA-Seq using fqtrim.

  - ```Trimmed_DATA_ID.fastq```: High-quality RNA-Seq generated by Trimmomatic.

- **Extract Unmapped Reads**

  This function integrates several bioinformatic softwares including HISAT2 (Kim et al., 2015), SAMTools (Li et al., 2009), and BEDTools (Quinlan et al., 2010) to extract unmapped reads. Firstly, HISAT2 is used to align user-defined high-quality reads to reference genome. Secondly, SAMTools is used to extract unmapped alignments in SAM format from alignments generated by HISAT2 with parameter "-f 4". Finally, BEDTools is used to convert the unmapped alignments in SAM format to FASTQ format. In addition, CAFU also supports dual RNA-Seq analysis by aligning RNA-Seq data to multiple reference genomes.

  To run this module, three inputs (see figure below) are required. Here, we still  use single-end RNA-Seq files in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/``` to show how to use this module.
 
  **Inputs description:**\
  **Input 1:** A **collection** of reference genome. Upload files (```maize.fa.zip, Oryza.fa.zip, Sorghum.fa.zip```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/genomes/``` as a collection named as ```Ref_Genome``` (user-defined name). See section **Upload collection file** to learn how to upload a collection.\
  **Input 2:** A **collection** of single-end RNA-Seq files. Upload files in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/``` with **zip** suffix as a collection.\
  **Input 3:** A **regular** file containing mapping-operation information. Upload files in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/mapInfoSE``` as a regular file.\
  **Note:** Input 3 is a semicolon seperated matrix which contains two columns. The first column contains RNA-Seq ID in each experiment. The second column is the corresponding reference genome ID for each experiment.
  ```bash
  SRR2144382;maize
  SRR2144383;maize
  SRR2144384;Oryza
  SRR2144385;Oryza
  SRR2144410;Oryza
  SRR2144411;Sorghum
  SRR2144442;Sorghum
  SRR2144443;Sorghum
  ```
 
  ![Extrat unmapped reads](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/12.png)


  Then click **Execute** to start extracting unmapped reads using CAFU. After finishing this process, the final unmapped reads will be named as ```all_unmapped_reads.fastq``` (see figure below).


  ![unmapped reads output](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/13.png)


- **Remove Contamination**

  Considering that sequences obtained from impure nucleic acid preparations may contain DNA from sources other than the sample. Those sequence contaminations are a serious concern to the quality of the data used for downstream analysis. So in this module, potential contamination sequences are removed using Deconseq (Schmieder *et al*., 2011) with user-defined coverage and identity (e.g., 0.95) by aligning input reads to a contamination database. In the current version of CAFU, 3,529 bacterial and 81 viral reference genomes (download from NCBI on 2018/11/05) are provided as default, however, user-defined contamination database is also supported. 

  ![remove contamination](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/17.png)


  Then the clean reads with FASTQ format will be returned.


###  DE NOVO TRANSCRIPT ASSEMBLY OF UNMAPPED READS
- **Assemble Unmapped Reads**

  In this module, three steps including ***de novo* assembly of unmapped reads**, **remove redundancy of transcript fragments**, and **re-assembly transcript fragments** will be sequentially performed to assemble unmapped reads. In this tutorial, we will use the unmapped reads generated by module ```Extract Unmapped Reads``` as the input (see figure below).

  
  ![unmapped reads output](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/14.png
  

  Then assembled transcripts named as ```Unmapped_reads_de_novo_assembled_transcripts```  will be returned (see figure below).


  ![assembled transcripts](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/15.png)


### EVIDENCE SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLED TRANSCRITP
- **Expression-level Evidence**

  The function allows users to eliminate assembled transcripts with low read coverage and/or low expression abundance, which are likely assembly artifacts. RNA-Seq reads used for Assemble Unmapped Reads are mapped with newly assembled transcripts and reference transcripts by using bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2012). CAFU outputs the read coverage of assembled transcripts at single-base resolution using BEDTools (Quinlan et al., 2010), and estimates the expression abundance of all transcripts in terms of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) using RSEM (Li et al., 2011). Assembled transcripts with low read coverage (e.g., less than 10) and/or low expression (e.g., FPKM less than 1) in the majority of samples (e.g., 80%) are discarded.

  The only required input in this module is the newly assembled transcripts with FASTA format from unmapped reads. Here, we use the file ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/assembled_transcript.fasta``` to show CAFU's usage.


  ![expression-level](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/18.png)
  
  
  Then three files will be output:

  
  **Output 1**: ```Read coverage of each transcript in each sample```, a matrix whose rows represent transcripts, and columns represent read coverage.

  **Output 2**: ```Expression abundance of each transcripts in each sample```, a matrix whose rows represent transcripts, and columns represent expression abundance.

  **Output 3**: ```Confident transcript ID by Expression-level Evidence```, the common transcript ID from Confident transcript ID filtered by read coverage results and expression abundance.


- **Genome-level Evidence**
  
  This function can be used to identify de novo-assembled transcripts missing from the existing genome annotation. All the assembled transcripts are aligned to the reference genome sequences of the species of interests using GMAP (Wu *et al*., 2005), and selects the best genomic matches with high identity (e.g., â‰¥ 95%) and coverage (e.g., â‰¥ 95%). Users can also eliminate assembled transcripts with no introns, which could represent either noise or pseudogenes.
  
  To run this module, at least three inputs are required including:

  **Input 1**: Reference genome sequences of the species of interests (input as a data collection).

  **Input 2**: Assembled transcript sequences generated from Assemble Unmapped Reads.

  **Input 3**: Genome annotation of corresponding species with RNA-Seq samples (GFF/GTF format).

  **Input 4**: A character indicating the reference genome name (e.g. maize).


  ![genome-level](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/19.png)


  Then four outputs will be returned:

  **Output 1**: ```Integrated GMAP results of newly assembled transcripts against all reference genome sequences```: GMAP alignment results (coverage and identity) of each assembled transcript against all reference genome sequences.

  **Output 2**: ```Confitent transcript information```: Confident transcript information filtered by high coverage and identity.

  **Output 3**: ```The same/similar-intron transcript ID```: Assembled transcript ID which possess the same/similar intron with corresponding species reference transcripts.

  **Output 4**: ```Novel transcript ID```: Novel transcripts missing in the existing genome annotation.

- **Transcript-level Evidence**

  This function can be used to select assembled transcripts with high similarity to other well-annotated transcripts, such as full-length transcripts generated from single-molecule real-time sequencing and/or high-quality transcripts annotated in closely related species. After aligning assembled transcripts with other well-annotated transcripts with GAMP (Wu *et al*., 2005), CAFU outputs the best transcript alignments with high identity (e.g., â‰¥ 95%) and coverage (e.g., â‰¥ 95%).
  
  To run this module, at least two inputs are required including:

  **Input 1**: Reference sequence of well-annotated transcripts, such as full-length transcripts generated from single-molecule real-time sequencing and/or high-quality transcripts annotated in closely related species.

  **Input 2**: Assembled transcript sequences generated from Assemble Unmapped Reads.


   ![genome-level](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/22.png) 

   
   Then three outputs will be returned:

   **Output 1**: ```Integrated GMAP results of newly assembled transcripts against all reference transcript sequences```, GMAP alignment results (coverage and identity) of each assembled transcript against all other transcript sequences.

   **Output 2**: ```Confident transcript information```, Confident transcript information filtered by high coverage and identity.

   **Output 3**: ```Confident transcript ID```, ID of transcripts that high similarity comparing to other well-annotated transcripts.

- Protein-level Evidence

  In this module, coding potential evidence of transcripts is fistly evaluated using CPC2 (Kang *et al*., 2017). Then for coding transcripts, Pfam (Finn *et al*., 2014) will be used to identify the protein families. 
  
  Here, we use the file ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/assembled_transcript.fasta``` to execute this module.

  Then three outputs will be returned:

  **Output 1**: CPC2 output. A tab seperated matrix contains seven columns. Each column shows the sequence ID, putative peptide length, Fickett score, isoelectric point, the integrity of the orf, coding probability and the coding/noncoding classification label. More details about this output can be seen from [CPC2 official website](http://cpc2.cbi.pku.edu.cn/help.php). 

  **Output 2**: Confident transcript ID. 

  **Output 3**: A tab seperated matrix contains transcript ID, alignment start, alignment end, envelope start, envelope end, Hmm access, Hmm name, Type of domain, Hmm start, Hmm end, Hmm length, Bit score, E-value, Significance, Clan, etc.


### SPECIES ASSIGNMENT OF ASSEMBLED TRANSCRIPTS
- SAT

  SAT (Species Assignment of Transcripts) is a machine learning-based toolkit used for species assignment of transcritps assembled using unmapped reads from mixed-species (eg., pathogen-host) samples. 
  
  In this tutorial, we will show how to use SAT using all the FASTA format files in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SAT/```. To run SAT, at least three files are required including:

  **Input 1**: The positive coding sequences (CDS) with FASTA format.  

  **Input 2**: The negative coding sequences (CDS) with FASTA format.

  **Input 3**: The coding sequences (CDS) with FASTA format assembled using unmapped reads from mixed-species (e.g., pathogen-host) 

  ![assembled transcripts](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU/blob/master/CAFU_images/16.png)
